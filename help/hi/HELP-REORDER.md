# **Reorder**


- This setting allows you to **adjust the order of columns** and also **enable or disable** specific columns for display. It is **context sensitive button** so depending on the selected table (and tab), reorder settings would change.
- Long press and drag/drop a particular column to change the specific order of the column relative to other columns.
